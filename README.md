## The Content

This is the first element of **the Big Bang of Data Science**, **`Research from the Start to The End`**.  

I don’t want to stick to that _abstract and direct_ definition from the academic book, on the meaning of research, but from the industrial one. So, I believe **RESEARCH** is the _concertmaster_ with the highest leadership position among all the other parts that are responsible for the outcome of a product. Research is an art that identifies the identity and confirms the destiny of the product. Put simply, _if you have a bad research start_, no matter how well and advanced equipped you are, _I guarantee your product will be a failure_. To this end, the first book is carefully crafted to meet all the requirements to build your product on the right foundation of research method. Here is a quick view of the content of the book.

# Book competitive advantage

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> 1. In this book you will find **a few outlines** that deliver competitive advantages.  
The first three units present an **abstract/academic** presentation of research, then in _chapter four_ you have a **concrete implementation** in the form of **lab-discussion**. Where the lab is a real-life project. So, you are going to implement what you have learnt in theory. 
> 2. In **chapter six**, you are going to learn one of **the most important skills** that many are unable to do, and that is **how to build a research instrument**. So, you are going to see the steps on creating your own research instrument _to measure the variables of the research features_. As an outcome, you will no longer have to rely on **copy-paste** surveys and similar tools to collect data for the project.  
> 3. The **last chapter** is lab-02, where you are going to see the final implementation of research from an _industrial perspective_. You will see how all the academic information you have learnt by then is going just to be right used on real-life project.
